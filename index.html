            <h2>Meet Miles</h2>
            <p>Miles is truly one-of-a-kind - a testament to nature's beautiful diversity. Born with a rare intersex condition, he has both male and female reproductive organs (testicles, penis, and internal ovaries). This makes Miles extraordinarily unique, as true hermaphroditism occurs in only 0.0012% of dogs - less than 1 in 83,000.</p>
            
            <p>His amber coat and soulful eyes tell a story of survival and resilience that goes beyond his rare biological makeup. The combination of his intersex condition and his remarkable survival story makes him possibly one of the most unique dogs you'll ever encounter.</p>
            
            <p>Found in a remote wilderness area, Miles likely survived on his own for nearly a year before coming to the shelter - a remarkable display of intelligence and determination. Due to his limited early socialization with humans, he's extremely shy and will need a patient, understanding adopter willing to work at his pace.</p>
            
            <p>He's made slow but steady progress at our shelter, gradually learning to trust and eat in the presence of humans. At about 40 pounds, he's the perfect medium size - substantial but manageable in most living situations.</p>

            <h3>A Miracle Journey: Watch Miles Break Free</h3>
            <div style="background-color: #f9f5f0; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #e6ccb3; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">For nearly three months, Miles existed in a state of paralyzing fear at the shelter. Huddled in the corner of his kennel, he would tremble uncontrollably at the mere sound of a human voice. Staff never witnessed him standing, walking, or eating – activities he would only attempt when the building was completely empty overnight.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Even the most irresistible treats – hot dogs, cheese, steak – remained untouched if offered by human hands. His food bowl would be left full during the day, only to be found empty each morning. Most shelters would have deemed him unadoptable, too traumatized to rehabilitate.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">But the shelter director saw something in Miles' eyes – a flicker of a soul worth saving. When others suggested the kindest option might be euthanasia, she refused. "He deserves a chance," she insisted. One dedicated staff member, Sarah, made it her personal mission to reach him, sitting silently by his kennel for hours, day after day, simply reading aloud so he could grow accustomed to her voice.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">After weeks of this gentle persistence, the first breakthrough came – Miles accepted a tiny morsel of cheeseburger from Sarah's fingers, a moment so profound that staff members gathered to witness it found themselves fighting back tears. It was the first evidence that behind his wall of fear, Miles still had the capacity to trust.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Then came May 18, 2025 – the day that changed everything. In a moment of inspiration, Sarah introduced Miles to Fiona, a gentle female shelter dog. What happened next left everyone speechless.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Miles, who had never even stood up in the presence of humans, began to play. The dog who had been frozen in terror for months suddenly transformed – running, jumping, play-bowing – his entire being radiating joy that had been imprisoned for so long. When staff shared this video, there wasn't a dry eye among those who had witnessed his painful journey. It wasn't just play they were seeing – it was rebirth.</p>

            <p>This Pride Month, we're celebrating Miles as a beautiful reminder that diversity exists naturally in all species.

            <p>His journey to becoming a confident companion will take time, but for the right person willing to champion his cause, the reward of earning his trust will be immeasurable.</p>
